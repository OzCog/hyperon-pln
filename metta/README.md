# Chaining Experiments in MeTTa

- backward-chaining: backward chaining experiments, both using proof
  as program and proof as program execution trace.

- forward-chaining: forward chaining experiments, both using proof as
  program and proof as program execution trace.

- polyward-chaining: forward chaining experiments combined with
  backward chaining.

- hol: higher order logic, attempt to reason about programs, such as
  providing that 0 is the right identity of +.

- inference-control: inference control experiments, replace depth by
  control functions.

- iterative-chaining: save intermediary results while reasoning.

- synthesis: program synthesis experiments (backward chaining).

- subtyping: subtyping inference experiments.

- sumo: attempt to reason over sumo.
